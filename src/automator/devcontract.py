"""Translate the generic `bmad-dev-auto` skill's output into the orchestrator's
result.json contract.

Alex Verhovsky's upstream `bmad-dev-auto` skill (BMAD-METHOD PR #2500) is a
decoupled autonomous-coding primitive: it writes NO result.json. Its outcome
lives in the spec it produced — `status:` in the frontmatter (the machine-
consumable signal) plus an appended `## Auto Run Result` prose section (intended
for an LLM deciding how to handle failure). This module is the thin Python shim
that turns that on-disk spec into the legacy result dict that verify.py /
escalation.py already consume, so the rest of the pipeline stays unchanged.

DOCTRINE — never trust prose for a gate. The frontmatter `status:` read straight
off disk is authoritative; the `## Auto Run Result` prose is only used to route
the blocked→PAUSE decision and to carry a human-readable detail. Where the two
disagree we surface it (`status_consistent=False`) so the caller can fail safe
(treat a mismatch as a retry rather than silently proceeding). Every real
deterministic gate (git baseline, worktree-changed, sprint advancement, dw_id
match) still runs in verify.py against actual on-disk state.
