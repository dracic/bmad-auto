"""Cross-platform process primitives.

The pid kill/liveness primitives now live behind the :class:`~automator.process_host.ProcessHost`
seam; ``terminate_pid``/``pid_alive`` remain here as thin back-compat shims that
delegate to it. ``detach_kwargs`` stays a real implementation — it is spawn
configuration, not a process-lifecycle primitive, so it does not belong on the
host. On Linux/macOS — and WSL, which *is* Linux — these preserve today's exact
behavior; the Windows branch degrades gracefully and is not yet exercised.
