    untracked work. `baseline_untracked` is the snapshot taken when the baseline
    was captured; None (a pre-upgrade run with no snapshot) removes nothing.

    `preserve` is repo-relative posix dir prefixes (the BMAD artifact folders)

    only guards untracked deletion, not tracked reverts. We can't ride the stash
    snapshot for it: `git stash create` emits an empty snapshot for a clean tree,

    (no strip, no stderr merge) so the patch stays applyable.

    max_file_bytes caps the size of each *untracked* file included: a file larger
    than the cap is skipped and replaced with a one-line marker naming it and its
