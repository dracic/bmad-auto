"""PII-scrubbing chokepoint for `bmad-auto probe-adapter` and `bmad-auto diagnose`.

Pure stdlib, no automator imports — the single audited place that decides what
data from a foreign CLI (or a user's own run dir) is safe to show a maintainer.
Both the probe and the diagnostic-dump commands route every captured payload,
help/version blob, discovered path, and run-state value through here before
rendering; nothing is displayed raw.

Guarantees:
- token *counts* are non-PII, so numbers/bools/null pass through verbatim;
- dict **keys** are kept verbatim — field names/casing are the whole point of a
  payload probe — but every leaf **string** is `$HOME`-redacted and then kept
  ONLY if it matches a conservative identifier shape (a short slug with no
  spaces / `@` / `/`, e.g. ``claude-opus-4-8`` or ``session-abc_123``);
  anything else (prose, code, paths, emails) becomes ``<redacted:str>``;
- an identifier-shaped string that looks like a **secret** (a known credential
  prefix such as ``ghp_``/``sk-``/``AKIA``, a JWT, or a long high-entropy blob)
  becomes ``<redacted:secret>`` even though it would otherwise pass — the one
  hole the identifier shape would leave open;
- list lengths are preserved (the count is structural, the contents aren't);
- recursion is depth-guarded so a pathological payload can't blow the stack.

It also offers two helpers the dump leans on but the probe does not need:
:class:`Pseudonymizer` (stable, irreversible per-dump aliases for proprietary
identifiers — story keys, branches, SHAs — that *are* identifier-shaped and so
would otherwise survive verbatim) and :func:`assert_no_leak` (a final-output
self-check the dump runs over its own rendered bytes before writing, so a
routing bug or a future field can never silently ship a secret/PII/path).
