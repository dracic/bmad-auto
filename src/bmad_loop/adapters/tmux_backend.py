"""POSIX tmux backend for the terminal-multiplexer seam.

The tmux/POSIX-shell quarantine spans this file and its base
(:mod:`.tmux_base`) — together they are the **only** place in the codebase
allowed to shell out to ``tmux``, so a future non-POSIX backend (an eventual
native-Windows "psmux") can replace them wholesale. All argv construction and
the single spawn primitive live in :class:`~.tmux_base.BaseTmuxBackend`; this
leaf is the POSIX implementation and inherits the full contract, adding only
the POSIX launch-pid prelude to each coding-CLI window (DW-507) and the
``inherited_env`` query psmux must not inherit (#731). See
:mod:`.multiplexer` for the contract.

``subprocess`` and ``shutil`` are imported (and re-exported) here so existing
callers and tests can still reach the spawn seam via ``tmux_backend.subprocess``
/ ``tmux_backend.shutil``; the live calls run through ``tmux_base``.

        The command runs behind a small ``/bin/sh -c`` prelude (DW-507) that exports
        :data:`~.tmux_base.LAUNCH_PID_ENV` as its own ``$$`` and then ``exec``s
        ``"${SHELL:-/bin/sh}" -c <command>``: the relays need the launched
        CLI's pid to tag hook lineage, and that pid is known only in-pane.
        tmux's ``default-shell`` semantics are preserved — tmux sets ``SHELL``
        to its ``default-shell`` in every pane (even over ``-e SHELL=``), so
        the command runs under that shell exactly as before, and whatever it
        sources for a ``-c`` command (fish's ``config.fish``, zsh's
        ``.zshenv``) still applies. The program is the absolute ``/bin/sh``,
        never a PATH lookup, so a profile's ``[env] PATH`` overlay cannot
        re-point it. The prelude's ``exec`` keeps ``$$``
        the pane's process: bash and zsh then exec a single ``-c`` command, so
        the recorded pid IS the CLI's; fish and dash (Debian/Ubuntu ``/bin/sh``,
        0.5.12) fork it, so the pid is the shell's and the relays' launch-chain
        rule skips the CLI under it.

        The prelude lives on this POSIX leaf, not the base: it is POSIX source
        built as a literal argv, and an out-of-tree tmux-family leaf that swaps
        only ``_shell_wrap`` for another dialect must keep inheriting the base's
        plain command (its hook lineage then reads ``unknown``, which
        attribution ignores).
