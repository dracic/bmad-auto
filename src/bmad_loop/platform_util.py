"""Cross-platform process primitives.

The pid kill/liveness primitives now live behind the :class:`~bmad_loop.process_host.ProcessHost`
seam; ``terminate_pid``/``pid_alive`` remain here as thin back-compat shims that
delegate to it. ``detach_kwargs`` stays a real implementation — it is spawn
configuration, not a process-lifecycle primitive, so it does not belong on the
host. On Linux/macOS — and WSL, which *is* Linux — these preserve today's exact
behavior. The win32 file-replace and path-segment helpers below (``atomic_replace``,
``safe_segment``) are exercised by the platform tests; the pid kill/liveness
Windows branch degrades gracefully and is not yet exercised.
