"""The library-level read-model projection layer for the ``--json`` contract.

Domain object in, contract document dict out. Every builder here is a pure
projection — it reads an already-loaded domain object (a ``ValidationReport``, a
``RunState``, a list of ``Decision`` / ``RunInfo``) and returns the plain dict
that :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` serializes. No I/O, no process state, no printing,
no exit codes: the caller loads, this layer projects, ``machine.emit`` writes.

Each command owns its own ``*_SCHEMA_VERSION`` constant and obeys the pure-document
contract documented in :mod:`bmad_loop.machine` — one JSON object, additive-only
evolution, anything breaking bumps that command's version. Those constants live
here, next to the builders they version, because a field and its version bump are
one edit.

This mirrors the split :mod:`bmad_loop.probe` and :mod:`bmad_loop.diagnostics`
already make — one finding, two render targets — generalized to the commands whose
document is a dict rather than a rendered string. The point of the separation is
that the contract is not a CLI feature: a future non-CLI frontend (the planned web
backend) imports these builders directly and serializes them itself, never
shelling out to the CLI to parse its stdout. Keeping them in ``cli.py`` made the
library surface reachable only through ``argparse``, and made every new command's
document another few hundred lines of accretion in the dispatch module.

So: add a new command's builder here, not in ``cli.py``. ``cli.py`` re-imports
these names, which is what keeps ``cli.STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION`` and friends
resolving for existing callers and tests.

Every name in this module is public, and a new builder must be too: the
projection surface *is* the API, so a leading underscore would say "do not
import this" about the one thing the module exists to be imported for. The
builders carried one until #212 only because they were born private inside
``cli.py``. ``run_token_totals`` is public for the same reason even though it
projects no document of its own — ``cmd_status`` calls it across the module
boundary to render text, and a private name imported by another module is the
contradiction this module is meant not to have. Keep genuinely intra-module
helpers private, as :mod:`bmad_loop.probe` and :mod:`bmad_loop.diagnostics` do.

    """The `validate --json` document: the verdict plus every check that produced it.

    Obeys the pure-document contract in machine.py (additive-only evolution;
    anything breaking bumps VALIDATE_SCHEMA_VERSION). ``ok`` is true when no
    finding has severity ``problem`` — warnings do not clear it — so it mirrors
    the exit code exactly. This is the first ``--json`` command that emits a whole
    document at rc 1: the nonzero code is the verdict being reported, not a
    failure to produce one (see machine.py on parsing non-empty stdout whatever
    the exit code).

    Three things a consumer has to know:

    - **``message`` is not contracted.** Several problems are a bare ``str(e)``
      from the config, policy, profile and sprint-status exceptions, so their
      wording moves with those modules. ``check`` is the only matchable identity;
      match on it, and read ``message``/``detail`` for humans.
    - **Absence is not a pass.** The gates are chained: if policy fails to load,
      ``profiles`` is empty and the binary, hook and base-skill gates contribute
      no finding at all. A check id missing from ``findings`` means "did not run",
      never "passed" — check ``ok`` for the verdict, not the absence of an id.
    - **``mux.backends-detected`` is gated on more than one registered backend**,
      so a lone-tmux host carries no backend inventory. Same rule as above.

    ``findings`` stays flat and in emission order rather than grouped by severity:
    grouping would destroy the cross-severity ordering (the order the gates ran)
    and turn "every non-ok finding" into a two-array concatenation.
