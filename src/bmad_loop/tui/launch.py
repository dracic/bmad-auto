"""Detached launching of bmad-loop commands for the TUI.

The TUI never runs engines in-process: run/sweep/resume are launched in new
windows of a dedicated control session (bmad-loop-ctl on tmux, a per-registry
name on psmux — see the CTL_SESSION comment below) so they survive TUI exit,
and the dashboard observes them through run-dir artifacts exactly like runs
started from a plain shell. Fast read-only commands (validate,
--dry-run) are captured instead, for display in a modal.

      forever otherwise, and it raises `MemoryError` rather than the OSError
      this promises never to leak — `Exception` would catch that but also mask
      real bugs, where a cap removes the condition instead of absorbing it.

    The check is on the descriptor, not the path, so it cannot be raced: fstat

    Ceiling: when the removal fails, or is declined because the path cannot be
    vouched for, the superseded id survives on disk. It still has to pass
    ctl_window_id's re-prove, so the worst it can answer is a live window
    carrying this run's name — the pre-fix by-name result, never a wilder target.
    Retaining a stale hint is strictly the cheaper failure here, which is why
    this declines rather than deleting on a path it cannot stand behind.

    Anchored exactly like the write in _record_ctl_window, and for a sharper
    reason: a delete needs no race at all. `unlink` does not follow a link at the
    *final* component, but the ancestors resolve normally, so a run dir standing
    as a link to an external directory makes `run_dir / ctl-window` name a file
    over there — another project's live record — and this deletes it. The write
    path's escape needed the attacker to win a window between check and write;
    a planted link just sits there until the next launch fails to capture an id.
    So the descriptor from `open_dir_confined` is what the unlink is relative to,

    `follow_symlinks=False` refuses a link at the *final* component only, which
    leaves the ancestors: a session that replaces `.bmad-loop/runs/<run_id>`
    with a link to an external directory holding a `state.json` passes
    `runs.is_run` — it follows the link — and then `mkstemp`/`os.replace` land
    the record inside the linked-to directory. The escape is narrower than the
    final-component one (the name written is always `ctl-window`, so the reach
    is another project's record rather than any file), but it is the same shape.

    Every component below `project` is checked, and `project` itself is not: the
    operator chooses where the project lives and may well keep it behind a link,
    while everything under it is session-writable. `lstat`-based throughout, so
    the check never resolves through what it is testing for.

    Each component goes through `_is_link_of_any_kind`, not `is_symlink()` —
    on win32 the latter is blind to a junction, which redirects the same way and
    is the easier of the two to plant. That also fixes a quieter gap: `Path`'s

    over an older window sharing the run id.

    Best-effort on purpose. The window is already running by the time this
    writes, so a failed write must not fail the launch — the lookup degrades to
    the name scan, i.e. to the behaviour before this record existed. A failure
    forgets the previous record rather than leaving it: degrading to the scan is
    the intended fallback, answering a superseded window is not.

    Skipped when there is no run yet: a fresh `run`/`sweep` mints the only
    window carrying its run id (nothing to disambiguate), and the run dir is
    created by the detached child — this record deliberately never mkdirs one,
    and must not be written into a run-dir-shaped directory (pruned, partial)
    that runs.is_run reports as not a run.

    That skip forgets too, and the "nothing to disambiguate" clause above is
    exactly why it must. The clause holds for the case it was written for —
    `new_run_id` mints a fresh id, so no other window carries it — but it does
    not hold for every way of reaching this branch. resume/resolve read state,
    raise a confirm modal, and launch from the callback, so anything that
    removes `state.json` inside that human-length window arrives here with a
    predecessor window live and a previous launch's record still on disk. That
    record names the window this launch just superseded, and ctl_window_id
    prefers any record that still resolves — so `a` and `x` would answer the
    parked predecessor while the orchestrator just minted keeps running, which
    is #482's symptom reintroduced by the record meant to fix it. Dropping it
    puts the lookup back on the name scan, which is this file's stated
    preference throughout: degrading to the scan is the intended fallback,
    answering a superseded window is not.

    Atomic, not a bare write_text: the record is read cross-process (`bmad-loop
    attach`), and on win32 an AV/indexer holding the previous record open fails
    a plain overwrite with a transient sharing violation — which would swallow
    into the forget path and quietly degrade the lookup. atomic_replace retries
    exactly that violation, turning most real-world failures into successes.

    The guard is type-agnostic on purpose, and `OSError` is not wide enough to
    hold it: `atomic_write_text` resolves the path before its own try, and below
    3.13 `Path.resolve` reports a symlink loop as `RuntimeError` — which would
    crash the launch this docstring promises to spare, on the interpreters the
    3.11/3.12 legs run. Same widening, same reason, as the engine's deferred-close
    rollback (`Engine._restore_deferred_closes`). `Exception` and not
    `BaseException`, so a genuine KeyboardInterrupt still gets out.

    `follow_symlinks=False`, so a symlink at the path is replaced rather than
    written through. Following one is the helper's default contract ("a ledger
    symlinked into the repo keeps being a symlink"), and it is right there — for
    an operator-curated ledger. This sidecar is the opposite: machine-minted,
    per-run, disposable, and living under the project root that every coding
    session can write. Honouring a link here would let a session aim a
    *host-side* write at any path the user can write — reach that the adapters
    confining a session to the workspace otherwise deny it. The payload is only
    a window id, so the primitive is truncation rather than injection, which
    bounds the damage without making it acceptable.

    Replacing rather than refusing, and no preflight `is_symlink` check: a check
    leaves the window between itself and the write, which a session that
    re-plants the link wins. `os.replace` does not dereference its destination,
    so the link is clobbered whenever it was planted. That also self-heals — the
    record ends up a plain file again — where a refusal would leave the planted
    link in place for the next launch to trip over.

    Anchored at a directory descriptor where the platform has one. The final
    component is covered by `follow_symlinks=False` above, but the *ancestors*
    are not, and a path check over them (`_run_dir_is_confined`) is answered
    about a path — stale the moment it returns, so a session that re-plants
    `.bmad-loop/runs/<run_id>` between check and write still redirects the
    record out of the workspace. `open_dir_confined` walks those components
    `O_NOFOLLOW` and hands back the descriptor for the directory it reached, and
    `atomic_write_text_at` then never names a path again — so a later swap
    renames something this no longer consults, and there is no window to win.

    win32 keeps the check-then-write path: it has no `*at()` family to anchor
    against (its CPython config defines neither HAVE_RENAMEAT nor HAVE_OPENAT),
    so the descriptor cannot be opened there at all. The residual is documented
    on `_run_dir_is_confined` and bounded by the two facts it names — same uid
    as the writer, and a fixed filename carrying a window id.

    control-session window hosting this run's orchestrator process
    (start_detached names windows <kind>-<run_id>), or None when the run was
    not launched from the TUI or the session is gone.

    An id, not a name, because every consumer replays the value as a
    select/kill/option target: one resolve feeds all of them, so a rename or a
    window minted between two verbs cannot send them to different windows, and
    the value survives tmux's automatic-rename.

    `<kind>-<run_id>` is not unique — a resume launched over a still-parked run
    window shares the run id, and nothing reaps the parked one in between — so
    the name scan alone answers whichever match the listing emits first (tmux
    orders by window *index*, and it gives a new window the lowest free index,
    so a superseded window usually but not always sorts ahead of the live one).
    The id the run's last launch minted is recorded in the run dir and wins
    whenever the listing still shows it under this run id. A record that is gone
    (killed, pruned) or now carries another run's name is ignored rather than
    replayed: a target that no longer resolves is the dangerous kind of stale —
    on psmux an unresolvable `-t` lands on the *active* window (psmux/psmux#545;
    tmux merely errors, which the best-effort consumers turn into a silent
    no-op). With no record at all the answer is the first tagged match.

    Scoped to `project` by the PROJECT_OPTION tag, and by nothing else: only a
    row carrying one of this project's accepted tags is a candidate. The control
    session is shared across projects, and a run id is only unique within one
    (`--run-id` is caller-supplied), so a same-id window belonging to another
    project would otherwise be a legal match here — for `x` that means killing a
    *live* orchestrator next door. _ctl_window_candidates reads tags by the same
    rule, but only that half is shared: its untagged windows are still admitted
    by the run dir, because the pruning consumer of that shape is #419's.

    An untagged row is never a candidate, however it is vouched for (#750).
    Every proof tried for one was a fact the workspace can forge. The run dir is
    a coincidence of a caller-supplied id (#531). The record lives under the
    project root every coding session can write, and the window id it names is
    a reusable handle — tmux 3.4 and psmux 3.3.8 both restart at `@0`/`@1` after
    a server restart. A pane pid recorded beside it is observable rather than
    secret: any same-UID process reads it from the process table, along with the
    `TMUX` socket path in the pane's environment, and anything minted into the
    window at creation passes through the multiplexer client's argv, which the
    process table also shows. The tag is the one claim that needs a write
    through the multiplexer to forge, so it is the whole proof.

    The honest bar, then: forging ownership here requires a mux write, exactly
    as forging the tag does — no more, and no less. On a host where the coding
    session runs unsandboxed as the same user, that is any process that can
    find the socket, which the pane environment hands out; the gate is only as
    strong as the session's isolation from the multiplexer.

    What it costs is reach for a window whose tag cannot be read as ours: one
    whose best-effort tag write failed at launch (start_detached records before
    it tags, but the record admits nothing on its own), and — every window at
    once — a listing whose option column could not be read at all, which psmux
    folds to "" rather than failing (PsmuxMultiplexer.list_windows). The seam
    hands both back as the same empty tag, so neither this function nor its
    callers can tell them apart. Fail closed is still right — the alternative
    is not "reach my window" but "reach *a* window", possibly a neighbour's live
    orchestrator — but it must not be silent: a None here reads as "no window",
    and `x` would then report the run stopped while its window keeps running.
    So ctl_window_lookup also counts the same-run rows it refused for want of a
    readable tag, and `x` and `a` say so (see kill_ctl_window and the TUI's
    attach) instead of passing the refusal off as an absence.

    Read-only throughout: this never writes the record and never touches the
    tag — re-tagging on read is claiming, not proving, and would hand a

      - a pane target (backend-composed: bare %N on tmux, =session:%N on
        psmux): switch that client back there (`-l` fallback if it's gone);
      - RETURN_DETACH: detach the client so a blocking `tmux attach` returns;
      - unset/empty: nobody attached with a return target — do nothing.
    The option is cleared only on RETURNED: a real return must not make the
    parked window's trailer fire a second one, a failed return is left for the
    trailer to retry. That retry is a second chance, not a rescue —
    new_parked_window parks on a blocking read *before* the trailer, so it runs
    only once a human dismisses the park prompt, never in the unattended case.

    The two failures are not interchangeable, which is why this answers a
    ReturnOutcome and not a bool. A failed switch is positive evidence that the
    client is still in this window, so ATTENDED keeps the caller prompting —
    but only because the seam reserves False for that joint claim. A backend
    that merely cannot vouch for the move (psmux's timed-out verb, an
    unreadable client count, nothing attached to move) answers None, and that
    lands in UNREACHABLE instead. The routing is load-bearing, not tidiness:
    an ATTENDED the client has already walked away from cannot be recovered by
    the surviving return option, because a --repeat cycle prompting into the
    empty window blocks on input() before anyone can reach the trailer. A
    failed detach carries no such evidence in general: on tmux it does
    (`detach-client` fails with "no current client"), but off tmux False also
    covers an effect the backend could not observe and a detach verb it does
    not have at all — herdr, whose False rather than None is exactly what
    detach_client's own widening to a returned bool (#317) buys. That is a
    different widening from switch_client's third state above; detach_client is
    the verb that stays a bool. UNREACHABLE is the policy for all of them, the
    unvouched switch included, because the two ways of being wrong are not
    equally bad: prompting into a
    window no one is viewing blocks a --repeat sweep on input() forever, while
    going unattended in front of a human only defers this cycle's decisions to

    The three lists are like runs.prune_sessions, but do NOT read the arms across:
    that one partitions BEFORE its kills, so its `killed` is still an attempted
    kill, its `live` is "deliberately not touched" rather than "survived", and its
    `unknown` is a pid question and a SUBSET of `killed`. These three are disjoint
    (by window id — the values are names) and all three are about kill outcome.

    kill_window is best-effort by contract (a hang, a missing binary, and a
    refused kill are all the same silent no-op), so an attempted kill is not a
    removal and must not be reported as one (#435). The verdict is taken here
    rather than pushed into the seam because this is the caller that both needs
    it and already holds the session: kill_window(target) alone cannot verify
    anything on a backend whose liveness listing is session-scoped, which is all
    of them.

    ONE listing after the whole fan-out, not a probe per window: the answer is a
    set membership either way, so the verdict costs one extra round trip instead
    of N. A transport fault raises and nothing can be claimed there.

    One ceiling, deliberate: the membership test pairs list_windows' `window_id`
    column with list_window_ids. The seam states its symmetry rules pairwise and
    this pair is stated because of THIS caller — a backend qualifying one side
    and not the other reads every candidate as removed, which is #435 restored
    on the optimistic side, with no error anywhere.

    `[]` is read as "the session went with its last window", and since #525 the
    seam means exactly that: a listing that merely FAILED raises instead of
    folding to `[]`, so it lands in `unverifiable` below rather than reporting
    every candidate removed. The narrow reading is what keeps the pessimism
    honest in the other direction too — a genuinely vanished session still
    answers `[]`, so its kills are reported as removed instead of leaving a
    phantom survivor for every future sweep to re-report.

    policy.toml, which the settings editor can rewrite under a running TUI. A
    TUI that started honouring the operator's root and then had the switch
    turned off would launch children into the derived root while it goes on
    querying the old one: it could not see, attach to or stop what it started.
    So the child's answer is predicted here with the same pure rule it will
    apply (`runs.resolve_psmux_registry_root`), from the root it inherits —
    this process's root in force — and a disagreement refuses the launch.
    The child receives that root in its argv (`--registry-root`, see
    `start_detached`), so the prediction holds under `PSMUX_BARE_ENV` too,
    where a pane inherits no `PSMUX_DATA_DIR`.

    Asked only of a process that configured its registry for this project
    (`runs.settled_project`), which every CLI entry does: there is nothing to
    disagree with otherwise. The other direction (switch turned ON) leaves the
    child where this process is — it inherits the derived root, which the rule
    never honours as a pin — but no longer where the operator is: a TUI that
    overrode the operator's root R recorded it as displaced, and with the
    switch now on, every shell carrying R would honour it while this TUI and
    its children stay in the derived registry. That is refused too. A TUI

    RETURN_OPTION recorded on the window by set_return_pane.

    Returns the new window's stable backend id (bare `@N` on tmux,
    session-qualified on psmux) so callers can target it unambiguously (window
    names collide when several kinds share a run_id). The same id is recorded in
    the run dir so ctl_window_id answers this window rather than an older one
    under the same run id — see _record_ctl_window.

    Refuses a run id that aliases a control session, FIRST — this is the one
    place every drive path converges on the mutation (the window mint and the
    ctl-window record overwrite): run/sweep launches with freshly validated
    ids, and resume/resolve replaying ids an older release persisted. Gating
    each button separately kept finding the path nobody gated (resolve was
    the fourth); gating the mutation cannot. Ahead of the mux probes so the
    refusal needs no transport to be phrased.

    Hands the window this process's state root, as the hidden top-level
    ``--state-root`` ahead of the subcommand, and on a transport that
    namespaces registries the registry root in force as ``--registry-root``.
    The window would otherwise inherit both from the multiplexer server, which
    may have started under another root (#731) or clear its panes' env
    (``PSMUX_BARE_ENV``, #730), and the engine would write where this process
    never looks. No state root, no launch: omitting the option would let the
    engine inherit whatever the server holds, and a launcher that cannot name
    a root could not watch the run anyway. The registry root restores only
    what inheritance would have delivered; the child's ``_configure_mux``
    still decides whether it is honoured. On psmux the argv reaches the child
    intact because a window launch refuses PowerShell older than 7.3 (#862).

    Also forwards this process's displaced psmux registry root, as the hidden
    top-level ``--displaced-registry-root`` ahead of the subcommand. The child
    inherits the derived root and so displaces nothing itself; without the
    option a TUI-launched resume or cleanup would never sweep the operator's
    pre-#537 registry, which only this process recorded. A root of the shape

    the launch itself succeeded.

    Two ways to land there, one signal: the backend captured no id, or it did but
    the record did not survive (refused, unwritable, run dir pruned mid-launch).
    Both leave `ctl_window_id` on the scan, so reporting only the first would let
    the rest degrade behind an unqualified success toast.

    Verified by re-reading rather than by threading the write's outcome up: it
    asks the question the consumers actually ask — will `ctl_window_id` prefer
    this window — of the same file they will read, instead of a proxy for it.

    Folded into the return here, rather than reported alongside the id as the
    resolve path does, because resume has no immediate use for a window it
    cannot record: it launches and leaves, where resolve attaches to the window
    it just minted and still needs that id to do so."""
