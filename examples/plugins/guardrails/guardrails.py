"""Guardrails — the worked-example in-process plugin.

Read this alongside docs/plugin-authoring-guide.md. In ~40 lines it touches every
extension point a plugin author is likely to use:

  * **a setting** — declared in plugin.toml as ``[[settings]]`` and read here via
    ``self.settings`` (manifest defaults overlaid by ``[plugins.guardrails]`` in
    policy.toml). It renders in the settings TUI once the plugin is enabled.
  * **an observe hook** — ``on_pre_story`` reads the read-only context and records
    a running count in the cross-stage ``ctx.shared`` dict, which the engine
    persists in ``RunState.plugin_shared`` so it survives pause/resume.
  * **a veto / validation gate** — ``on_pre_dev_phase`` maps a policy decision
    onto the engine's *existing* control flow via ``ctx.veto(...)``. There is no
    new abort path: ``skip`` retires the unit quietly, ``defer`` notifies, and
    ``pause`` escalates (raises RunPaused). The engine resolves the
    most-conservative veto when several plugins object.
  * **a context mutation** — ``on_pre_commit`` rewrites the proposed commit
    message. Only the whitelisted ``proposed_*`` fields are writable; the
    identity/git/result fields are read-only.

The provided workflow (an extra agent session at post_dev_phase) is declared
entirely in plugin.toml — no Python needed for it.

A hook handler may raise freely: the bus isolates the failure, journals it, and
disables this instance for the rest of the run. Because ``fail_closed`` is left
False (the default), such a bug fails *open* — it never wedges a real run. Set
``fail_closed = True`` on the class to make a raised handler additionally defer
the current unit.
