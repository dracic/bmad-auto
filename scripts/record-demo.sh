# Record the README demo GIF of a bmad-auto run / TUI session.
#
# Two routes, pick whichever you have:
#
#   1. VHS (charmbracelet/vhs) — DETERMINISTIC, scripted, repeatable. Best for a
#      clean README hero. Drives a real terminal from the .tape script below.
#         install: https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs   (`go install` or your pkg mgr)
#         run:     scripts/record-demo.sh vhs
#
#   2. asciinema + agg — records a REAL interactive run you drive by hand, then
#      converts the cast to a GIF. Best when you want a genuine live run.
#         install: https://docs.asciinema.org  +  https://github.com/asciinema/agg
#         run:     scripts/record-demo.sh cast     # records; Ctrl-D / `exit` to stop
#                  scripts/record-demo.sh gif      # converts the cast to docs/images/demo.gif
#
# Output: docs/images/demo.gif  (uncomment the embed block in README.md to use it).
