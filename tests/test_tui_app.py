    A screen-type `until` returns the instant push_screen swaps app.screen — before

    OutOfBounds, region still 0). Gating on a real on-screen region makes the

    widgets mount and lay out together, so one gate covers every field in it.

    That gate alone stopped being enough once BaseDialog grew breakpoints (#281).
    The breakpoint class is on the screen by the time the first widget has a
    region — but the stylesheet reapply it triggers is still QUEUED, so the first
    laid-out pass carries the un-classed metrics and the real layout arrives a
    frame later. Measured on StoryCheckpointModal at 45 columns, the docked row
    reads Textual's default `Button min-width: 16` on that first pass

    screen) and the `-narrow` metrics (14/10/7) on the next.

    `StoryTask._serialized_worktree_path` persists an isolated unit's `spec_file`
    RELATIVE to the mounted worktree and `from_dict` reads it back raw, so
    `_paused_spec`'s bare `Path(task.spec_file)` resolved against the TUI process cwd
    — the project root, which carries the very same `epic-1/stories/...` layout. Both
    destructive writers then landed on the MAIN CHECKOUT's twin: `confine_root` (the
    project) accepted it because it genuinely is under `project`, `reset_spec_status`
    answered True, the operator got a "plan reset to draft" notice and the run
    resumed — while the worktree's real spec kept its terminal status, so the next
    dispatch did not re-plan, and an unrelated tracked file was rewritten.

    The cwd is set EXPLICITLY: pytest does not run from the sandbox, so without the
    `chdir` the reverted code would merely fail to resolve the relpath and this row
    would pass for the wrong reason instead of reproducing the hazard. The two copies
    carry distinguishable bodies for the same reason — "the right file was written"
    has to be checkable against "the other one was not".

    `confine_root` is captured as well as graded on bytes, because the two halves are
    not one ablation: the worktree here is UNDER `project` (that is where
    `workspace.open_unit_workspace` mounts it), so a root reverted to `self.project`
    still lands on the right file — it just silently drops both writers off the
    confined arm and loses its O_NOFOLLOW walk (#593), with no signal at all.

    Ablations: revert `_paused_spec` to `Path(task.spec_file)` and this reddens on
    the worktree copy's status AND on the twin's byte-identity; pass `self.project`

    the shape that matters: `resolve.run_session` is the only thing in `src/` that

    what it KNOWS — it ran no session — rather than from what is on disk, which is
    exactly the verdict `_restore_recorded` already records for this surface.

    The watermark is seeded to 1 over a two-record trail so "did not move" is

    """A contended run is REFUSED with a toast, not queued behind its holder.

    `_do_rearm` runs ON Textual's message loop: it carries no `@work`, and its only
    caller is the synchronous `push_screen` dismiss callback, so the acquisition
    happens inline and the whole dashboard freezes for however long the holder keeps
    the lock — unbounded on POSIX, where `fcntl.flock` never times out. The realistic
    holder is a rival `resume`, which takes the lock FIRST and publishes its pid LAST,
    so the modal's `_engine_possibly_live` gate reads dead for that entire window (the
    same window `cmd_clean` documents) and does not head the freeze off.

    The contention is real — the run's own canonical sidecar — and taken through
    `platform_util.file_lock` rather than `journal.state_lock` for the reason
    test_cleanup states: `state_lock`'s reentrancy guard is thread-local, so acquiring
    it here would let `_do_rearm` RE-ENTER the lock and pass for the wrong reason. The
    holder sits on a background thread with a BOUNDED hold so that a regression to a
    blocking acquire reddens on `elapsed` instead of hanging the suite.

    Ablations, both of which must redden this: (1) MOVE the `except
    LockUnavailableError` arm below the existing `except (RearmError, OSError,
    runs.StateRootError)` — the subclass makes the moved arm dead and contention is
    filed as "re-arm failed"; (2) drop `blocking=False` and the gesture queues for the
    holder's full hold.

    `runs.rearm_event_notice` only buys anything if the TUI is graded against the
    table's whole vocabulary, so this walks a record of every arm the old copy
    missed plus the new spec-flip skip.

    Two renderings, not two tables: the severity map is graded here too (`note` is
    Textual's `information`, `warning` stays `warning`), as is the deliberate drop
    of `next_step` — its imperative reads "... before resuming" and the resume is
    already queued behind this toast.

    Ablation: make `runs.rearm_event_notice` return None for any one of these kinds
    and this reddens on that kind's message alone. Drop the remedy
    ("restore it from git or from your own copy") from the `rearm-aborted` `failed`
    MESSAGE while keeping it in that arm's `next_step` and only the remedy assertion
    reddens — which is the point of grading it here rather than on the CLI, where the
    dropped half is still printed.

    derived from the state root, which gives it two new ways to fail: `OSError`
    from the acquisition itself, and `runs.StateRootError` from deriving the
    path. The second is NOT an `OSError`, and here that distinction is not

    down mid-walk, with the human's remaining answers unrecorded and no window

    Both are raised, in that order, across two pending decisions: the first
    grades the arm that already existed, the second grades the widened tuple.
    The second modal appearing at all is what says the walk continued rather
    than stopping at the first failure, and it is keyed on the modal's own
    decision id so a first modal that simply never dismissed cannot satisfy it.
