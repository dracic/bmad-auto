"""Live psmux gate: cross-project prune isolation and selected workaround premises.

The unit acceptance test (test_psmux_backend) proves the candidate scan with a
faked subprocess; what no unit layer can prove is the transport half — a real
psmux server holding two projects' windows on one shared control session, a
prune in one project, and the other project's window *and its option keys*
surviving the kill. Same zero-token contract as test_opencode_live: parked
windows run a plain `exit 0`, no coding CLI is ever launched.

The `test_premise_*` probes observe upstream psmux behavior *directly* — raw argv, no
backend verb under test — so the assumptions the workarounds in psmux_backend
are built on stop being a human's reading of a changelog. These probes invert
the usual failure semantics: a red probe is the intended signal, and it means
the workaround its message names has become droppable, not that the suite
broke. Each message says which one. The scaffolding assertions inside those
probes — session/window mint, focus setup, reads whose value is not itself the
premise — carry a ``probe setup: `` prefix instead, so an instrument failure is
never read as a premise flip.

The `test_adopted_*` probes are the ordinary-direction complement: each
exercises a behavior the 3.3.8 floor let the backend assume (several through
the backend verb itself, deliberately), so a red probe there means psmux
regressed, not that a workaround became droppable.

Windows-local by construction (psmux registers for win32 only); skipped
everywhere else, and when psmux is absent or an unsupported version.
